# Kotlin Learning Journey

## About This Repository
This repository documents my journey of learning **Kotlin** from **Philipp Lackner's YouTube playlist**. Each commit represents my progress as I complete videos from the playlist, and each file corresponds to a specific lesson or concept covered in the video.

## Learning Structure
- The playlist consists of **27 videos**.
- Each video covers a different topic related to Kotlin programming.
- I will create a separate file for each video to track my progress clearly.
